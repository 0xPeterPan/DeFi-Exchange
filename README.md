# Crypto Devils Decentralised-Exchange

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Build your own Decentralized Exchange like Uniswap

1. This is an exchange with only one asset pair (Eth / Crypto Devil).

2. The Dex should take a fees of 1% on swaps.

3. When user adds liquidity, they should be given Crypto Devil LP tokens (Liquidity Provider tokens).

4. CD LP tokens should be given proportional to the Ether user is willing to add to the liquidity.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Personally, I always deploy on Vercel; not only my Next.js projects, but also my React.js projects.
